Static site generator used for my blog at [voidma.in](https://voidma.in/).

## Project structure

The file `blog-gen.cabal` is generated by `hpack` using `package.yaml`,
and should only be regenerated if `package.yaml` changes.

Both Nix and HLS use `blog-gen.cabal` to determine the project structure.

To build the site generator, run `nix build`.
It can be found in `./result/bin/site`.
The Direnv shell contains NPM and other dependencies needed to build the site.
